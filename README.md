# E-Commerce Store
This project was built as a fully functional, medieval, e-commerce website with a firebase login page.

Navigating through this page, the first page/pages visited are the 'login' or 'create account' htmls. The visitor is prompted to login, create an account, or the visitor can, in this case, skip the entire login feature by pressing 'click me!' button in order to view the project.

The store front page features a currency converter, different product sections, a product cart, and a checkout feauture which calculates the difference between amount paid vs amount owed.

An online version of this project is viewable via the website in my bio :)
